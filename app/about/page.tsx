        <p>**About Me**</p>
<div>
Hello! I’m a passionate software engineer and front-end developer 
based in the United States. With a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Houston (summa cum laude) 
and currently pursuing my Master, I’ve spent the last four years building engaging, scalable
web experiences for a leading telecommunications client.

**My Journey**
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>
        **Early Career**: Started as the sole on-shore developer for Privacy Center project, collaborating with a global team to design and implement secure, user-friendly interfaces.

        </li>
        **Digital Assets & Site Development**: Took on senior responsibilities—managing website, leading peer reviews and onboarding, and rolling out promotion campaigns using AEM, React, Next.js, HTML, and CSS.

        <li>
        **Continuous Learning**: Outside of my day-to-day, I’ve been diving into Python, machine learning, and deep learning—building mini-projects in PyTorch, experimenting with CNNs, and exploring data-driven visualizations.

        </li>

    </ul>

<div>
**What I Do**
    <ul>
        <li>
        **Front-end Craftsmanship**: Craft pixel-perfect UIs with React and Next.js, integrate headless CMSs (AEM, Contentful), and optimize performance for thousands of daily users.

        </li>
        <li>
        **Full-stack Exploration**: Write clean RESTful APIs in Node.js and Python, build simple machine-learning pipelines, and deploy end-to-end demos to AWS.

        </li>
        
        <li>
        **Collaborative Growth**: Mentor junior developers, conduct code reviews, and contribute to cross-functional design, marketing, and content teams.

        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
**Outside the Code**
When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me:
<ul>
<li>
    *Reading up on the latest in AI and cloud computing

</li>
<li>
*Sketching UI ideas in Figma or Miro
</li>
<li>
Juggling life with my 10-month-old (and a strong cup of coffee ☕)
</li>
</ul>
